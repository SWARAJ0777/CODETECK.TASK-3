Overview of the project of task 3
Project Overview: Automated PDF Report Generation
Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a Python script that automates the process of reading, analyzing data from a file (like a CSV), and generating a formatted PDF report with summary statistics. This report can be used for business insights, data-driven decision-making, or sharing analysis results with stakeholders in a professional format.

Key Activities:
1. Data Loading:
The script reads data from a CSV file using pandas. This could be a file with any tabular data, such as sales, employee records, or survey results.
Basic error handling is included to ensure the file exists and contains data.
2. Data Analysis:
The script performs basic statistical analysis on the data, generating summary statistics such as:
Count of rows
Mean, Min, and Max values
Standard deviation, quartiles, etc.
This step helps to summarize key trends in the dataset (e.g., average values, distribution).
3. PDF Report Generation:
Using the FPDF library, the script creates a professionally formatted PDF.
The report includes:
Header with a title.
Body displaying summary statistics.
Footer with page numbers for readability.
Custom methods are used to add titles and sections, making the report structured and readable.
4. Saving the Report:
The generated PDF is saved to the local system, and the user is notified upon successful creation.

Technology Used:
1. Programming Language:
Python: The core language used to write the script due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries for data analysis and PDF generation.
2. Libraries:
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, specifically for reading CSV files and calculating summary statistics.
FPDF: A Python library for generating PDF files. It is used here to format and output the analyzed data in a clean, readable PDF document.
3. Data Format:
CSV (Comma-Separated Values): The input file format containing the dataset for analysis.
